Ha! What a curveball. I had barely set up my desk in my new role when I heard the big news — our team was pivoting! But for me, the real challenge wasn’t the pivot itself. It was figuring out where to find solid data to validate our **user persona**.<br/>

The core concept of the service was already set: providing transparent and detailed information on cosmetic procedures to bridge the information gap in the skincare market. But before moving forward, we needed to confirm who our actual users were — not just who we assumed they would be.<br/>

Our assumption? Mid-30s to early 40s who could afford pricey cosmetic procedures. But assumptions mean nothing without data. And if there’s one thing I refused to do, it was building based on guesswork. **I was determined to validate our user persona with real data — no shortcuts.**<br/>

## **A Marketing Experiment That Took Off**

To verify our target audience, we needed a creative approach. Around that time, MBTI personality tests were everywhere in Korea, appealing to all age groups. So, we took that trend and adapted it into a skin type test. Users would answer a few questions and receive skincare procedure recommendations based on their skin type and age group. This allowed us to collect age demographics naturally (without making it feel intrusive.)<br/>

To avoid skewing the test toward a single age group, we carefully distributed it across different online communities and social media channels where each demographic was concentrated.<br/>

The result? A total success.<br/>

## **Surprising Demographics and Market Trends**

Our initial assumption was that most participants would be in their mid-30s to early 40s. But the actual data told a different story. The largest age group turned out to be mid-20s to mid-30s, with a particularly high concentration (31%) in the 25-30 range.<br/>

Digging deeper, we conducted interviews with multiple dermatology clinics and discovered a rising trend: more young professionals were spending money on skincare treatments as soon as they started working. With increased promotional events and more affordable pricing, visiting dermatologists had become a common habit among this demographic.<br/>

## **An Unexpected Insight: The Parent Factor**

Another surprising finding was that about 10% of participants were in their 50s and 60s — a demographic we hadn’t anticipated at all. By analysing user behaviour, we uncovered an interesting pattern. Since the test allowed multiple attempts, we noticed that many accounts first completed the test as a 20-something or 30-something and then retook it as a 50-something or 60-something.<br/>

Can you guess why?<br/>

Our best explanation was that their children were introducing the test to their parents. A later round of participant interviews confirmed this hypothesis: many participants had their parents take the test, as gifting skincare treatments for birthdays or Mother’s Day was becoming a trend.<br/>

## **From Insights to Product Features**

This data-driven approach didn’t just help us define our target audience — it also directly influenced our product design. With a clearer understanding of user behaviour, we adjusted the UI/UX to better serve our actual audience. And as a bonus, we introduced a new feature: “Recommended Treatments for Parents.”<br/>

This experience reinforced a key lesson: **Again, don't assume! The most valuable insights emerge when data challenges assumptions and real user behaviour guides decisions.**
