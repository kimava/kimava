### Here’s the thing:

I'm picking up a project which I started about a year ago with a couple of friends but didn’t manage to finish (I didn’t even get halfway, if I’m honest). Now I’m bringing it back to life.

Why did I quit halfway, you ask? A bit too much drama.

Anyway, I couldn’t stop thinking about it and I really liked the concept, so here I am.

I’ve decided to rework it.

<br/>

### What's Different This Time

A few things are going to be different this time:

<br/>

**I’m doing it solo**

Which means I’ll be setting up my own database and building APIs, which is exciting!

The designer’s already finished her part, so there’s not much to do on that side.

<br/>

**Switching to English**

Since I’m in London now. (yay!!), I’ll be switching the language to English

The project will be basically for foreigners who have trouble finding bins in Seoul or who fancy joining some plogging activities.

<br/>

**Upgrading to Next.js 14**

Next.js has moved from version 13 to 14 while I’ve been away, so I’ll be incorporating that as well.

<br/>

**Finishing with grace**

I'm determined to finish it no matter what this time. I also want to do it properly with better code quality, proper test coverage, and solid type definitions.

<br/>

Now it’s time to crack on!
